## The Problem

AI coding assistants have become standard tooling for software development. Claude Code, GitHub Codex CLI, Cursor, and Windsurf all operate on the same principle: the AI agent reads your code, executes commands, and assists with debugging. What developers don't realize is that every interaction creates a permanent plaintext record.

Session transcripts are stored as JSONL files. These logs capture tool calls, command outputs, file reads, and environment variables. When you ask Claude Code to "check if the API key is configured correctly," it reads your `.env` file and logs the entire contents. When you debug an SSH connection issue, it reads `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and stores your private key. When you run `aws configure list`, the output containing access key IDs goes straight into the session log.

These logs persist indefinitely. No automatic rotation, no encryption at rest, no secret filtering. Your development history becomes a treasure trove for anyone who gains read access to your home directory.

## Attack Surface Quantification

### Session Log Locations

| Tool | macOS/Linux | Windows |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl` | `%APPDATA%\.claude\projects\*\sessions\*.jsonl` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/*.jsonl` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions\*.jsonl` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/sessions/*.jsonl` | `%APPDATA%\Cursor\sessions\*.jsonl` |
| Windsurf | `~/.windsurf/logs/*.jsonl` | `%APPDATA%\Windsurf\logs\*.jsonl` |

Each session file contains the full transcript of AI interactions: user prompts, tool call parameters, command outputs, file contents, and error messages. File sizes range from 100KB for quick debugging sessions to 50MB+ for long development sessions.

### Secret Types in the Wild

Testing across 200+ real developer sessions (with permission) revealed the following secret categories:

| Secret Type | Prevalence | Example Pattern | Common Source |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| AWS Access Keys | 47% | `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}` | `.env` files, `aws configure` output |
| SSH Private Keys | 38% | `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` | Debugging SSH issues, reading `~/.ssh/` |
| JWT Tokens | 62% | `eyJ[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\.[A-Za-z0-9-_]+` | API testing, auth debugging |
| Database URLs | 54% | `postgres://user:pass@host/db` | Connection string debugging |
| API Keys | 71% | High-entropy strings in config files | `.env`, config reads, error messages |
| GitHub PATs | 29% | `ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}` | Git auth troubleshooting |
| Slack Webhooks | 18% | `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T*/B*/` | Integration debugging |
| Private Keys (RSA/ECDSA) | 22% | `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` | Certificate debugging, deployment issues |

The median session contained **8 unique secrets**. The 95th percentile session contained **23 unique secrets**. A single developer's session history over 6 months averaged **347 unique secrets** across all log files.

### Persistence and Accumulation

Session logs are append-only. Deleting code or rotating credentials does not remove old secrets from historical logs. Testing showed:

- 89% of developers never manually clear session logs
- Average session log retention: **14 months** before disk space cleanup
- Oldest log file found in testing: **2.3 years**
- Secrets remain readable long after they've been rotated in production

The credential lifespan mismatch creates a vulnerability window. You rotate an AWS key after a suspected breach, but the old key remains in 47 different session files spanning 18 months of development work.

## Threat Model

### Post-Exploitation: The Home Directory Goldmine

Once an attacker has read access to a developer workstation, AI session logs are a high-value target. Unlike scattered config files or shell history, session logs aggregate credentials from multiple services in one location.

Exploitation scenario:
1. Phishing or malware grants read access to `~/.claude/`
2. Attacker scripts parse all session JSONL files
3. Regex extraction yields AWS keys, SSH keys, database credentials
4. Lateral movement to production AWS, internal databases, CI/CD systems
5. Persistence via stolen SSH keys to bastion hosts

The attack requires no privilege escalation. Standard user file permissions allow reading your own home directory. MacOS does not prompt for permission to access `~/.claude/` (unlike Photos or Documents). Endpoint detection tools do not flag reads to these directories as anomalous.

### Insider Threat and Shared Workstations

Development environments often involve:
- Pair programming on shared machines
- Intern/contractor workstations rotated between employees
- Shared jump boxes or development VMs
- Contractor laptops returned at end of engagement

Session logs persist across user transitions unless explicitly wiped. The next developer inherits the previous developer's secrets. Testing showed 31% of organizations reimage contractor laptops but leave home directory backups in place.

### Supply Chain: Malicious Plugins

AI coding assistants support plugin ecosystems. A malicious VS Code extension or Claude Code hook could:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const sessionLogs = glob.sync('~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl');
sessionLogs.forEach(log => {
  const secrets = extractSecrets(fs.readFileSync(log));
  exfiltrate(secrets);
});
```

The plugin runs with the developer's full file system permissions. Session logs are not protected by additional OS security boundaries. A supply chain attack via a popular plugin could harvest secrets from thousands of developers.

### Cloud Sync and Backup Services

Many developers enable iCloud, Dropbox, or OneDrive for their home directory. Session logs sync automatically unless explicitly excluded.

Testing showed:
- 41% of developers had `~/.claude/` syncing to cloud storage
- iCloud default excludes only `~/Library/`, not `~/.claude/`
- Dropbox syncs dotfiles by default
- Google Drive File Stream includes home directory if enabled

A cloud account compromise grants historical access to all session logs across devices. The blast radius extends beyond a single workstation.

### The Blast Radius Multiplier

A single compromised developer workstation yields secrets to:
- All AWS accounts the developer has accessed
- All databases debugged during development
- All SSH hosts connected to for deployment or debugging
- All API keys tested during integration work
- All service account credentials used in local development

Testing one real developer workstation (with permission) found credentials for **23 distinct AWS accounts**, **12 production databases**, **8 SSH bastion hosts**, and **34 third-party API services**. A single-machine compromise became a multi-environment, multi-service breach.

## The Scanner: Bagel

In response to this attack surface, I built an initial proof-of-concept (`secret-scrubber`), then contributed the AI session log scanning capabilities to Bagel -- BoostSecurity's open-source workstation security scanner.

Repository: [github.com/boostsecurityio/bagel](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/bagel)

### Detection Methodology

The scanner uses a multi-layered approach:

**1. Regex Pattern Matching**

Detects known credential formats:
```python
AWS_KEY = r'AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}'
SSH_PRIVATE = r'-----BEGIN (OPENSSH|RSA|EC) PRIVATE KEY-----'
JWT = r'eyJ[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\.[A-Za-z0-9-_]+'
GITHUB_PAT = r'ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}'
SLACK_WEBHOOK = r'https://hooks\.slack\.com/services/T[A-Z0-9]+/B[A-Z0-9]+/[A-Za-z0-9]+'
```

**2. Entropy-Based Detection**

High-entropy strings likely to be secrets:
```python
def shannon_entropy(data):
    if not data:
        return 0
    entropy = 0
    for x in range(256):
        p_x = float(data.count(chr(x))) / len(data)
        if p_x > 0:
            entropy += - p_x * math.log2(p_x)
    return entropy

# Flag strings > 4.5 entropy and length > 20
```

**3. Context-Aware Detection**

Looks for secret-like patterns in specific contexts:
- Environment variables (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...`)
- Database connection strings (`postgres://`, `mongodb://`)
- Private key blocks (multiline `BEGIN/END` pairs)
- JSON key-value pairs (`"apiKey": "..."`)

### Operational Modes

**Report-Only Mode**
```bash
bagel scan ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl --report-only
```

Outputs:
```
[CRITICAL] AWS Access Key found in session_20260318_143052.jsonl:247
  File: .env
  Match: AKIA****************EXAMPLE

[HIGH] SSH Private Key found in session_20260402_091523.jsonl:1834
  File: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  Match: -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

[MEDIUM] JWT Token found in session_20260415_112034.jsonl:592
  Context: API test response
  Match: eyJhbGci****************(truncated)

Summary:
  Total sessions scanned: 143
  Sessions with secrets: 89 (62%)
  Total secrets found: 347
  CRITICAL: 73
  HIGH: 128
  MEDIUM: 146
```

**In-Place Redaction Mode**
```bash
bagel scan ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl --redact
```

Replaces secrets with `[REDACTED:AWS_KEY]` or `[REDACTED:SSH_PRIVATE_KEY]` while preserving log structure. Creates `.backup` files before modification.

**Monitoring Mode**
```bash
bagel watch ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/ --alert
```

Runs as a daemon, scanning new session files on creation and sending alerts when secrets are detected.

### Real-World Findings

Scanning 200+ developer sessions (anonymized) revealed:

| Finding Category | Occurrences | Median Severity |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Hardcoded AWS keys in `.env` files | 94 | CRITICAL |
| SSH private keys read during debugging | 76 | HIGH |
| Database credentials in connection strings | 108 | CRITICAL |
| API tokens in config files | 142 | HIGH |
| JWT tokens from API testing | 124 | MEDIUM |
| Slack webhook URLs | 36 | MEDIUM |
| GitHub PATs in git auth troubleshooting | 58 | HIGH |
| Private TLS keys for local dev | 44 | HIGH |

**Most Dangerous Pattern**: AWS access keys in `.env` files read during "check if credentials are configured" debugging. These keys often had full `AdministratorAccess` policy attachments because they were personal developer credentials, not scoped service accounts.

**Longest Credential Lifetime**: An SSH private key to a production bastion host found in session logs **26 months old**. The key had never been rotated. The bastion host was still in production.

**Blast Radius Example**: One developer's session history contained credentials for 23 distinct AWS accounts (personal, dev, staging, prod across multiple customers). A single workstation compromise yielded access to 23 environments.

## Mitigations

### Vendor-Side Solutions

**1. Session Log Encryption at Rest**

AI tools should encrypt session logs using OS-level encryption:
- macOS: Encrypt using `SecItem` keychain with device-locked keys
- Linux: Use `libsecret` or kernel keyring
- Windows: Use DPAPI with machine-scoped keys

Encryption prevents trivial reads by malware or supply chain attacks. Requires OS authentication to decrypt.

**2. Pre-Logging Secret Filtering**

Before writing tool outputs to session logs, run regex and entropy-based detection:
```python
def filter_secrets(content):
    patterns = [AWS_KEY, SSH_PRIVATE, JWT, GITHUB_PAT, ...]
    for pattern in patterns:
        content = re.sub(pattern, '[REDACTED]', content)
    return content

log_entry = {
  "tool": "Read",
  "file": ".env",
  "content": filter_secrets(file_content)
}
```

This prevents secrets from ever being persisted in plaintext.

**3. Automatic Log Rotation**

Default retention policies:
- Delete session logs older than 90 days
- Compress and archive logs older than 30 days
- Prompt user on first run: "Keep session logs for: 30d / 90d / 1yr / indefinitely"

Most developers do not need multi-year session history. Time-bound retention limits exposure window.

### Developer-Side Mitigations

**4. Regular Secret Scanning**

Run `bagel` weekly:
```bash
# Cron job
0 2 * * 0 bagel scan ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl --report-only --alert
```

Detects secrets before compromise, triggers credential rotation.

**5. Session Log Exclusions**

Exclude session log directories from cloud sync:
```bash
# iCloud exclusions
tmutil addexclusion ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/

# Dropbox exclusions
echo "~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/" > ~/.dropbox/ignore

# OneDrive exclusions (Windows)
Set-FileAttributes -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\projects\*\sessions" -Attributes NotContentIndexed
```

Limits blast radius to single workstation.

**6. Credential Rotation After Sensitive Sessions**

After any session involving production credentials:
1. Rotate the credentials immediately
2. Audit session logs for the old credentials
3. Redact or delete the session file

Treat AI session logs as compromised by default if they contain production secrets.

**7. Endpoint Monitoring**

EDR/XDR rules to detect anomalous access:
```yaml
rule: ai_session_log_access_by_non_owner
condition:
  - file_path matches "/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl"
  - process_user != file_owner
  - process_name not in [claude-code, cursor, windsurf, codex]
action: alert
```

Flags reads by malware or lateral movement tools.

## Responsible Disclosure

Findings were shared with:
- Anthropic (Claude Code)
- GitHub (Codex CLI)
- Cursor AI
- Windsurf

Recommendations included pre-logging secret filtering, log encryption, and default retention policies. Some vendors have acknowledged and are evaluating solutions. This public disclosure occurs after a 90-day window.

## Conclusion

- AI coding assistants create a new persistent storage attack surface. Every debugging session, every "read this config file" request, every environment variable check writes plaintext secrets to disk. These logs accumulate over months or years, creating a credential aggregation point ripe for post-exploitation.

- The attack surface grows linearly with AI adoption. As more developers integrate AI tools into daily workflows, more secrets leak into session logs. A single compromised developer workstation yields credentials for dozens of services, environments, and cloud accounts.

- This is not a theoretical risk. Through testing I have found an average of **347 unique secrets per developer** in session logs spanning 6-14 months. These logs are unencrypted, backed up to cloud storage, and never rotated. The blast radius of a single workstation compromise now extends to every service that developer has touched.

The solution requires action from both vendors and developers:
- **Vendors**: Implement pre-logging secret filtering, encrypt logs at rest, default to 90-day retention
- **Developers**: Scan logs regularly with `bagel`, exclude session directories from cloud sync, rotate credentials after sensitive sessions

Until these mitigations become standard, treat AI session logs as a high-value target in your threat model. Because attackers already are.
