- As usual, we can register a user
- We are presented with a trading application, so might as well use it and see how it works

- Using our handy script, we find more information

`Endpoints Found: 31`

- We know now what we can abuse and search for

### MCP Burp Suite

- I asked GPT to search for anything, any api with admin, since the hint mentioned `Broken Access Control`, it could be very simple

- It went on to search but did not find what we were looking for
- Next up, I simply told it to try not to overthink it as it is very simple
- By this time I already found it, to my own surprise, that `/admin` works ... it was the quickest win!

- Ran the two-step test.
	- `Step 1: /api/admin/flag`
		- No auth → 401 {"error":"Access token required"}
		- With tester JWT (role=user) → 200 {"flag":"`bug{rWROg3bOL7OOlxN5gkf5gDqfIYurhtCg}`"}

  This confirms broken access control: a non-admin user can access the admin flag endpoint.

- Super simple and fast today
- Keep learning and be useful!

## Security Takeaways
### Impact

  - Non‑admin users can access admin‑only endpoints
  - Exposure of sensitive admin data (flag)
  - Confirms broken authorization at critical API paths

### Vulnerability Classification

  - OWASP Top 10: Broken Access Control
  - Vulnerability Type: Privilege bypass on admin endpoint
  - CWE: CWE-285 – Improper Authorization

### Root Cause
  - The /api/admin/flag endpoint verifies authentication but does not enforce role‑based authorization, allowing a standard user JWT to access admin data.

### Remediation

  - Enforce role checks on all /api/admin/* routes
  - Separate admin routes behind dedicated middleware
  - Add automated tests for authorization boundaries
  - Monitor and alert on access to admin endpoints by non‑admin roles
