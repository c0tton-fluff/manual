# Enumeration 

## Enumerate users and groups
 - [ ] List local users
 - [ ] List local groups
 - [ ] Currently logged on users
 - [ ] Last logins

## Check membership of interesting groups
 - [ ] wheel
 - [ ] docker
 - [ ] shadow
 - [ ] lxc and lxd
 - [ ] disk
 - [ ] adm

## Enumerate operating system information
 - [ ] Linux distribution
 - [ ] Kernel Version
 - [ ] Architecture (32 or 64 bit)
 - [ ] Is it AD domain joined?

## Enumerate network information
 - [ ] IP addresses and network interfaces
 - [ ] List active connections and listening ports

## Enumerate program and processes information

## Privilege Escalation 

### Global 
 - [ ] Identify the Linux distribution and Kernel version
 - [ ] Check for credentials in web application configuration files
 - [ ] Check interesting directories (e.g. /opt, /var/mail, etc.)
 - [ ] Check capabilities
 - [ ] Check if sudo version is vulnerable (CVE-2023–22809)
 - [ ] Internal Nmap scan
 - [ ] Check PwnKit
 - [ ] Check LogRotate (versions 3.8.8, 3.11.0, 3.15. and 3.18.0)
 - [ ] Monitor processes. Look for anything interesting.
 - [ ] Look for writable Docker socket files.
 - [ ] Look for Tmux sessions that can be hijacked
 - [ ] Check for NFS shares with no_root_squash enabled
 - [ ]  Check kernel exploits (e.g. DirtyCow, DirtyPipe)
 - [ ] Listen to traffic using TcpDump. Any cleartext credential?

### Per User 
 - [ ] Check which groups user belongs to
 - [ ] Check sudo rights
 - [ ] Check for environment variables
 - [ ] Look for ssh keys on home directory
 - [ ] Check for hidden files in home directory
 - [ ] Check history files on home directory
 - [ ] Hunt for interesting files
 - [ ] Enumerate SUID / GUID binaries

## Check for exploitable cronjobs:
 - [ ] System-wide cronjobs
 - [ ] User-specific cronjobs
 - [ ] Monitor processes for regularly repeating commands, suggesting a hidden cron job.
 - [ ] Try to read other user’s home directory (.ssh/id_rsa, .bash_history, etc.)
 - [ ] Try using user’s password for other users
 - [ ] Run linpeas.sh
