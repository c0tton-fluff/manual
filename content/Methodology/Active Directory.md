# Active Directory Compromise

## Live Host Enumeration 
- [ ] Conduct a ping sweep on the IP range
- [ ]  Use NetExec on the IP range (better information)
- [ ]  Use Responder to catch IP addresses


* Be sure to properly understand the role of each host. Do your service enumeration.

- [ ] User Enumeration 

* With foothold
- [ ] Get user list via SMB

* Without foothold

- [ ] Attempt to get user list via SMB Null Authentication
- [ ] Attempt to get user list via LDAP Anonymous Bind
- [ ] Attempt to get user list via RPCClient
- [ ] Attempt to get user list via RID brute-forcing
- [ ] Attempt to get user list via Kerbruting


* Some of these techniques are not guaranteed to discover all users. At least try the SMB, LDAP, RPCClient and RID methods.

* Get Foothold 
 - [ ] Find Kerberoastable users from the user list
 - [ ] Find ASREProastable users from the user list
 - [ ] Use Responder to catch credential hashes
 - [ ] Try SMB Null Authentication to spider through SMB shares looking for credentials
 - [ ] Get SYSTEM / root on Domain connected host to get a Computer account
 - [ ] As a last resource, try password spraying with the user list


* Password spraying can lock accounts due to repeated failed attempts and should be used cautiously.

* Attacks 
 - [ ] Use SharpHound to collect data to feed BloodHound
 - [ ] Check compromised hosts on BloodHound for outbound attack paths
 - [ ] Use NetExec to check for command execution via SMB, WinRM, and RDP for each compromised user.
 - [ ] Kerberoast
 - [ ] ASREProast
 - [ ] Look for credentials in GPOs (gpp_password, autologin)
 - [ ] For each compromised user, spider through readable SMB shares for sensitive information
 - [ ] For each compromised user, conduct SMB Hash Theft attacks on writable SMB shares
 
 - [ ] Look for passwords in user’s description fields
 - [ ] Check the DC’s SYSVOL SMB share for scripts containing credentials
 - [ ] NoPac
 - [ ] PrintNightmare
 - [ ] PetitPotam
 - [ ] Try compromised local administrator hashes on other hosts
 - [ ] Try Responder on different hosts
 - [ ] Look for users with the PASSWD_NOTREQD field
 - [ ] Password spray using previously found passwords
